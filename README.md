A basic prototype of a quiz application built with React. This project uses useCallback, useEffect, and useState hooks to manage question transitions based on timeouts. This is an ongoing practice project to enhance my React skills.

Feel free to use it as a reference or starting point for your own projects! I plan to keep adding new features and improvements over time.
